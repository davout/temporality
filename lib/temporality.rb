# = Temporality
#
# Root module for temporal functionality, include it in ActiveRecord classes
# to benefit from the temporality features.
#
# This functionality requires a +starts_on+ and +ends_on+ attribute pair defined
# on the models in which the module is included.
#
# == Example
#
# This will define three classes with temporality constraints. An employment
# contract will be required to be temporally within the bounds of the legal entity
# with which it is made. A contract will also be required to have a temporally
# complete set of compensation records.
#
#   class LegalEntity < ActiveRecord::Base
#     include Temporality
#     has_many :employment_contracts
#   end
#
#   class EmploymentContract < ActiveRecord::Base
#     include Temporality
#     has_many :compensations
#     belongs_to :legal_entity, temporality: {
#       inclusion: true,
#       auto_close: false,
#       completeness: false,
#       prevent_overlap: false
#     }
#   end
#
#   class Compensation < ActiveRecord::Base
#     include Temporality
#     belongs_to :employment_contract, temporality: {
#       inclusion: true,
#       auto_close: true,
#       completeness: true,
#       prevent_overlap: true
#     }
#   end
